## Overview
DearFriend is an innovative mobile application designed to empower visually impaired users by providing a suite of assistive features to enhance their independence and safety in daily tasks. The app integrates cutting-edge technologies to offer secure user authentication, object and text recognition, emergency alerts, and real-time volunteer assistance through video calls. Developed by a dedicated team of RMIT students, DearFriend aims to bridge the gap between accessibility and technology, ensuring users can navigate their environments with confidence.

---

## Features

### 1. Authentication and Profile Management
🔐 DearFriend includes a secure user authentication system powered by **Firebase** for database management. This ensures that only authorized users and volunteers can access the app. The profile management feature allows users to create and log in to their accounts, providing a personalized and secure experience.

- **Technologies Used**: Firebase for authentication and database management.
- **Developer**: Nguyen Vu Trong Nhan (s4028019@rmit.edu.vn) - Implemented login and registration functionalities.

---

### 2. Object Recognition with Text Recognition
👁️ One of DearFriend's standout features is its Object Recognition and Text Recognition capabilities, powered by the **MobileNetV2 Apple ML model**. Users can point their devices at objects or text, and the system identifies them, announcing the object's name or reading the text aloud using Text-to-Speech technology. These features reduce the need for external assistance, promoting independence in daily tasks such as identifying objects or reading labels.

- **Technologies Used**: MobileNetV2 Apple ML model for object and text detection, Text-to-Speech for audio feedback.
- **Developer**: Nguyen Vu Trong Nhan (s4028019@rmit.edu.vn) - Implemented accessibility features including Text-to-Speech integration.

---

### 3. Emergency Alert
🚨 The Emergency Alert system is designed to assist visually impaired users in critical situations. By activating the alert, users can send their IP address and location details to a pre-set emergency contact via text message. The system automatically retrieves the user’s location and sends it to the contact’s phone number, ensuring a quick response during emergencies.

---

### 4. Volunteer Video Call System
📞 A core feature of DearFriend is the Volunteer Video Call system, which connects users with volunteers for real-time assistance. Volunteers can guide users through tasks such as reading labels, navigating spaces, or identifying objects via video. The video call interface is designed to be simple and accessible, ensuring ease of use for visually impaired users.

- **Developer**: Nguyen Minh Khai (s3995223@rmit.edu.vn) - Developed the video call feature and designed its UI/UX.
